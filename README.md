### Welcome to Henry Lin's GitHub

I’m a final-year **Software Engineering student at The University of Queensland** passionate about brining ideas to life and making an impact to the world. When I'm not doing pest control or making dreams come true, I can be found experimenting with LLM models, 3d printing, bouldering, lifting weights and trying out new technology. 

🌱 Currently Working on:
- **Fortus** <a href="https://fortus.fit/"> Fitness tracking redefined
- **CausalGUI** - My final year thesis project
- 
🚀 Some of my projects include:
- **Buddy** – A social app that helps immigrant parents connect *(🏆 UQ Innovation Diversity Prize)*
- **FitQuest** – A full-stack fitness tracking app with AWS-hosted backend
- **Fortus** – Improving UI/UX and component architecture as a React Native developer
